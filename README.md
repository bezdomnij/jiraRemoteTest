With this project we continued our Jira automation test project. 
We created a pipeline with Jenkins and we can run our tests in Zalenium with 2 browsers at the same time.
Jenkins builds the project after every commit on the development branch - to test this a lot of "empty" commits had to be made.
Technologies used: Java, Maven, Junit5, Maven Sureifre Plugin, Jenkins, Zalenium.
